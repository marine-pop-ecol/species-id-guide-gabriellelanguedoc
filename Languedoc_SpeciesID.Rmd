# *Nucella ostrina* (Northern Striped Dogwinkle)

## Description

This whelk is distinguished by its alternating lines of thick and thin bands on its shell. Additionally, it can be identified by the three indistinct whorls on its shell. Colors can range from dark browns, blacks, and browns to light greys and oranges always with a purple interior (Meschkat et al., 2014). This snail typically lives in the mid to high intertidal zones of exposed rocky shorelines from the Bering Sea to Southern California. The end of its shell known as the umbilicus is closed. It is most commonly found along barnacle and mussel beds as this is their preferred diet. This species feeds by drilling a hole with its radula mouthpart into its prey and extracting digestive enzymes which are then extracted by its long proboscis (*E-Fauna BC Atlas Page*, 2021).  *N. ostrina* is commonly mistaken for the northern channeled dog winkle (*Nucella canaliculata*) as well as the proposed northern lined dog winkle (*Nucella analoga*). Both of these species can be distinguished from *N.ostrina* because of their slender distinctive whorls and smaller body sizes. To reproduce, females deposit leathery embryonic capsules attached by stalks to the rock from which the eggs develop and hatch as juveniles after about 2.5-4 months (Lloyd & Gosselin, 2007). Therefore, there is no larval feeding stage and maternal care is critical to the survival of the offspring. Each capsule will produce about 20 juveniles.

## Questions

1. Does this snail have a banding pattern that alternates between thick and thin stripes?
2. Does this snail have three indistinct whorls?
3. Is the inside of the shell purple?
