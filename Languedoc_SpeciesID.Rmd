# *Calliostoma ligatum* (Blue top snail)

## Description

*Calliostoma ligatum*'s shells are cone-shaped with three distinct convex whorls, and are generally 2.5 to 3 cm in diameter and 1.7 to 3 cm tall (Tuskes 2019; Crowles 2004; Meschkat et al., 2013). ). The colour of their unbeaded spiral ridges generally alternates between light golden or tan and chocolate brown, although spirals can be white, grey, black or red. If the shell is worn or damaged a distinctive blue inner layer is visible, which can also be seen in the inner edge of empty shells. The shell has a closed umbilicus, and its opening is rounded with a pearly interior. The snailâ€™s foot has a distinctive bright orange sole. 

*Calliostoma ligatum* is present from central Alaska to southern California (Metschkat et al., 2013; Harbo 2011). It can be found intertidally but also at depths of up to 30 meters in eel grass and kelp beds, and rocky areas. Blue top snails are omnivorous, and although they mainly consume *Macrocystis* and other brown algae they also eat diatoms, ascidians, sponges, bryozoans, and detritus (Crowles 2004; Meschkat et al., 2013). Their main predators are sea stars and sunflower stars, but, interestingly, they do not demonstrate antipredator behaviour towards predatory snails (Hoffman, 1980). As broadcast spawners, male *Calliostoma ligatum* release sperm into the water column, while eggs are released by females sheathed in mucous strands that await fertilization (Holyvoak 1988). After fertilization, they undergo several changes over 12 days to become planktonic larvae, veligers, and then juvenile snails. They reach sexual maturity after 1 year. Blue top snails may be confused for Purple-ringed top snails (*Calliostoma annulatum*), but the beaded spirals on Purple-ringed top snails are easily differentiated from the smooth spirals of Blue top snails. Other snails in the area either do not have a similar top-like shell morphology, or lack the distinguishable spirals and orange foot of the top snails. 


## Identification Questions

1) Is the shell of the snail top shaped (not cone shaped) with three convex whorls? 

2) Does the snail have a bright orange foot? 

3) Are the spiral ridges on the snail's shell smoothed (not beaded)?
